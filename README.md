## Key features

- **Optimized Mapping**: Our approach learns an optimized mapping from limited user inputs to high-dimensional robotic actions, enabling intuitive control.
  
- **Target Audience**: Designed for users with severe impairments who require low-DoF (degrees of freedom) input methods for robotic control.

- **Adaptive Goal Prediction**: Simultaneously infers the user’s intended goal state in real-time, adapting continuously.

- **Reinforcement Learning Guidance**: Utilizes RL to guide the agent’s actions towards the intended goal, even when the specific goal is initially unknown.

- **Blending Autonomy with User Input**: Achieves a fluid combination of autonomous assistance and user input, addressing challenges faced by traditional blending and arbitration methods.
